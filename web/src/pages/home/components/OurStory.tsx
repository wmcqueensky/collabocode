					The Story Behind CollaboCode
				</h2>
				<p className="text-gray-400">
					Most coding platforms are built for solo problem-solving. But
					interviews, team projects, and real-world software development demand
					something more — communication, collaboration, and fast thinking under
					pressure. That gap became clear when I was prepping alone — grinding
					LeetCode, second-guessing myself, and realizing that even with a study
					partner, we weren’t actually learning to work as a team.
				</p>
				<p className="text-gray-500">
					Built with developers, interviewers, and learners in mind, CollaboCode
					is the home for collaborative coding — whether you're prepping for a
					LeetCode grind or building a real project together.
