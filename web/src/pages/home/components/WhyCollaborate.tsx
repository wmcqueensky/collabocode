					Why Collaborative Coding?
				</h2>
				<p className="text-gray-400 text-lg">
					Great software is rarely built alone. Collaboration brings clarity,
					faster problem-solving, and real-time learning. You explain your
					thought process, challenge assumptions, and reduce time spent stuck in
					bugs. It's like pair programming—but more powerful.
				</p>
				<p className="text-gray-500">
					Studies show collaborative programmers are 2x more effective in
					debugging and 60% more likely to learn new techniques. Whether you're
					interviewing, building products, or solving practice problems—teams
					outperform individuals.
